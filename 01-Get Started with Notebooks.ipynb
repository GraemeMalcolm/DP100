    "Azure Machine Learning (*Azure ML*) is a cloud-based service for creating and managing machine learning solutions. It's designed to help data scientists leverage their existing data processing and model development skills and frameworks, and help them scale their workloads to the cloud. The Azure ML SDK for Python provides classes you can use to work with Azure ML in your Azure subscription.\n",

    "In most cases, you should store the workspace configuration in a JSON configuration file. This makes it easier to reconnect without needing to remember details like your Azure subscription ID. You can download the JSON configuration file from the blade for your workspace in the Azure portal, but if you're using a Compute Instance within your wokspace, the configuration file has already been downloaded to the root folder.\n",

The first time you run it in a notebook session, you'll be prompted to sign into Azure by clicking the https://microsoft.com/devicelogin link,  entering an automatically generated code, and signing into Azure. After you have successfully signed in, you can close the browser tab that was opened and return to this notebook."
