# Monitor Data Drift

Changing trends in data over time can reduce the accuracy of the predictions made by a model. Monitoring for this *data drift* and retraining as necessary is an important way to ensure your machine learning solution continues to predict accurately.

## Before You start

If you have not already done so, complete the *[Create and Explore an Azure Machine Learning Workspace](01-create-a-workspace.md)* exercise to create an Azure Machine Learning workspace and compute instance, and clone the notebooks required for this exercise.

## Open Jupyter

While you can use the **Notebooks** page in Azure Machine Learning studio to run notebooks, it's often more productive to use a more fully-featured notebook development environment like *Jupyter*.

1. In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com), view the **Compute** page for your workspace; and on the **Compute Instances** tab, start your compute instance if it is not already running.
2. When the compute instance is running, click the **Jupyter** link to open the Jupyter home page in a new browser tab.

## Monitor data drift for a dataset

In this exercise, the code to monitor data drift is provided in a notebook.

1. In the Jupyter home page, browse to the folder where you cloned the notebook repository, and open the **Monitor Data Drift** notebook.
2. Then read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.
3. When you have finished running the code in the notebook, on the **File** menu, click **Close and Halt** to close it and shut down its Python kernel. Then close all Jupyter browser tabs.

## Clean-up

If you're finished working with Azure Machine Learning for now, in Azure Machine Learning studio, on the **Compute** page, on the **Compute Instances** tab, select your compute instance and click **Stop** to shut it down. Otherwise, leave it running for the next lab.
